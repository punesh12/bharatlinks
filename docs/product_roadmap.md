# Product Roadmap & Features: "BharatLinks" (Placeholder Name)

## Unique Selling Proposition (USP)
**"The Smart Link Management Platform Operating at the Speed of Indian Business."**

Unlike global competitors (Bitly, TinyURL), this platform is built mobile-first and commerce-first to suit the unique behaviors of Indian users—heavy WhatsApp usage, UPI payments, and high-frequency, low-latency mobile interactions.

### Core USPs:
1.  **WhatsApp & Social Integration**: Deep linking that actually works, preview card customization for higher CTR on WhatsApp sharing.
2.  **Commerce Ready**: Smart links that can redirect to Payment Apps (UPI Deep links) or specific App Store/Play Store pages based on device.
3.  **Local Trust**: Servers hosted in India (Mumbai/Gurgaon) for near-instant redirection speeds for Indian users.

## Feature List

### 1. The Essentials (MVP)
*   **Instant Shortening**: Fast URL shortening with custom aliases (e.g., `lnk.in/diwali-sale`).
*   **QR Code Generator**: Basic QR codes for every link.
*   **Link Management**: Edit destination URL after creation (Dynamic Links).
*   **Basic Analytics**: Total Clicks, Device Type (Mobile vs Desktop), Referrer.
*   **UTM Builder & Templates**: Create and save UTM presets (Source, Medium, Campaign) to auto-tag links for consistent tracking.
*   **Workspaces**: Organize links into separate workspaces (e.g., "Personal", "Client A", "Marketing Team").

### 2. The "India-Specific" Power Features
*   **WhatsApp Smart-Share**: 
    *   Pre-generate the text and thumbnail that appears when the link is shared on WhatsApp.
    *   "Click to Chat" link generator for businesses.
*   **UPI Smart Links**: 
    *   Create a shorter link that triggers the user's UPI app directly for payments.
*   **Deep Linking**:
    *   Smart routing: Opens the YouTube app, Instagram app, or Amazon app directly instead of the browser (improves conversion by 2-3x).
*   **Geo-Targeting (State Level)**:
    *   Redirect users from "Maharashtra" to a Marathi landing page and "Tamil Nadu" to a Tamil page.

### 3. Business & Enterprise Features
*   **Branded Domains**: Connect `links.mybrand.com` instead of generic domains.
*   **Bulk Shortening**: CSV upload support for large SMS campaigns.
*   **Team Collaboration**: Multiple seats for marketing teams.
